    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective date: <strong>October 20, 2025</strong> · Last updated: <strong>October 20, 2025</strong></p>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Neomoji</strong> (“we”, “us”, or “our”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our mobile application (the “App”). By using the App you agree to the collection and use of information described here.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect limited information necessary to provide and improve the App’s features:</p>

      <h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Emojis, stickers, and images</strong> you create or import. These items are stored locally on your device and may be uploaded to our secure server if you choose to back up, share, or sync them.</li>
        <li>We only access or transmit your files when you explicitly choose to import, upload, back up, or share them.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Device &amp; Usage Information</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Anonymous technical data such as device model, operating system version, app version, crash logs, and usage statistics.</li>
        <li>Non-personal identifiers such as Advertising ID (used for ads personalization).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Advertising Data</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>We use third-party ad networks (for example, Google AdMob). These networks may collect Advertising ID, approximate location (to serve more relevant ads), and app usage interaction data.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. Permissions We Use and Why</h2>
      <p>The App requests permissions only to enable core features. We list the Android permissions the App uses and the purposes for each:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><code>INTERNET</code> — to show ads, connect to cloud backup, and update content.</li>
        <li><code>READ_MEDIA_IMAGES</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_VIDEO</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_AUDIO</code>, <code>READ_MEDIA_VISUAL_USER_SELECTED</code> (Android 13+) and <code>READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code>/<code>WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE</code> (older Android) — to allow you to import and use your own photos, videos, or audio in emoji creation and to save exports to your device. Access is limited to files you select or actions you explicitly perform.</li>
        <li><code>ACCESS_MEDIA_LOCATION</code> — to read location metadata (EXIF) embedded in media files you import, only if you choose to import such media; used exclusively to display or edit that media inside the App.</li>
        <li><code>VIBRATE</code> — to provide optional haptic feedback during editing or when saving an emoji.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="note">We do not access or transmit your files without your explicit action or permission.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How We Use the Information</h2>
      <p>We use collected data to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enable emoji creation, editing, saving, sharing, and optional cloud backup.</li>
        <li>Display relevant ads so the App can remain free to use.</li>
        <li>Improve app performance, diagnose crashes, and troubleshoot problems.</li>
        <li>Maintain security and detect or prevent abuse or fraud.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Data Storage &amp; Retention</h2>
      <p><strong>Local storage:</strong> Your emoji creations remain stored on your device and can be deleted anytime through the App or by uninstalling it.</p>
      <p><strong>Server/cloud storage:</strong> If you opt into cloud backup or sharing, your creations are uploaded to our secure servers and retained only as long as necessary for your use of the service or until you request deletion.</p>
      <p>We retain logs and analytics for troubleshooting and app improvement; retention periods are limited and do not include your full media content unless you back it up.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Sharing Your Information</h2>
      <p>We only share data in limited cases:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Third-party services that enable core features (for example, Google AdMob for advertising, Firebase for analytics/crash reporting, and our cloud storage provider). These providers have their own privacy practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal requirements:</strong> When required to comply with the law, legal process, or to protect our rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Third-party privacy references:</p>
      <ul>

        <li><a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Firebase — Privacy &amp; Security</a></li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
      <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights such as access, correction, deletion, or portability of your personal data and the right to opt out of personalized advertising. To exercise these rights, contact us at the email below.</p>
      <p>You can also delete all locally stored data by uninstalling the App.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
      <p>We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (such as HTTPS/TLS for network transfer) to protect data. While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure — please use caution when sharing sensitive media.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
      <p>The App is not directed at children under 13 (or under 16 in the EU). We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors. If you believe a child has provided personal data, contact us and we will delete the data as required.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated policy here with a revised “Last updated” date. Significant changes may also be communicated via the App or other channels.</p>
